    <p>Many expats opt to stay in a hotel for the first few weeks. This will give you time to discover the different
        neighborhoods of your city and pick the best place to start your property search. If you don't want to land
        without a place lined up, check out airbnb and book something from there. They have a lot of listings for
        Kaohsiung, and it will give you a place to head to once you exit the airport.</p>

    <h3>Finding a Permanent Rental</h3>

    <p>Finding a permanent rental will be a little more difficult than finding that first place to stay. You are
        usually required to sign a one year lease, and because of this, you will want to take your time to find
        something that is in the right area. Choosing an area will be easier if you know where you are going to be
        working. If you don't yet know where you will be working, getting something within walking distance of a
        subway station is always a pretty safe bet.</p>

    <p>You should also be mindful of the air quality. If your building is sitting on one of the busiest downtown
        intersections, the noise and exhaust smell is going to be much more problematic than if you were overlooking
        a park or the river. I personally preferred staying right by the river. It allowed for a beautiful place to walk
        in the mornings, and it provided bicycle trails along the river all the way up to my preferred shopping place:
        Carrefour.</p>

    <p>The best way to find a rental on your own is probably through the Taiwanese rental site,
        <a href="https://www.591.com.tw/" target="blank">591.com</a>
        Yes, this is in Chinese. Yes, google translate is a big help. This is the site I used to find a long-stay hotel,
        as well as a couple great apartment options. I used google translate to put together horribly translated
        text-messages or emails for the contact agent. They didn't always reply, but I did have some success.</p>

    <p>Another option (and the better option) is to hire a real estate agent. I found an agent (via word of
        mouth from the expat community) that charged a flat 1000NTD (about 30 USD) to take me around and
        show me properties. He asks what you are looking for, and sets up all the appointments for you.
        He'll come with you and do all the translating. This was SUCH a help, and gives you some credibility when
        meeting with potential landlords.</p>

    <p>Because the most helpful options always come from info you get from expats who have been around for a while,
        I can't stress enough the importance of getting out to meet other people ASAP. Go to church, hit up a
        foreign owned pub or restaurant, or just linger around the 7-11 at Love River on the weekends. These are all
        great ways to meet people who will be willing to help you.</p><br>
