    <p>Living in Kaohsiung is definitely going to be much cheaper than choosing Taipei. Rent is unbelievably cheap
        for what you can get, and eating out is pretty cheap as well.</p>

    <h3>Rent / Housing</h3>

    <p>Rent is going to be your biggest monthly expense. Considering that Kaohsiung is a huge metropolitan city, the
        rent prices are quite unbelievable. You can get a fully-furnished posh studio apartment downtown next to the
        river for about $400 per month. Did I mention this is in a fancy apartment building that has their own movie
        theater for residents, along with a workout room, and many other amenities? If you prefer something a little
        smaller or want to save even more money, it is completely possible to get a simple furnished studio apartment
        or room for $200 or less per month. The further you go from downtown, the less you are going to pay.</p>

    <h3>Transportation</h3>

    <p>Transportation isn't that expensive. As I mentioned before, you can ride the city bikes for free (or buy a
        decent bike for less than $50) and a trip on the subway costs a dollar or less. Uber is a little cheaper
        than taxis, and since it is more convenient there is no reason not to use it. A 15 minute cab ride across
        town ended up costing me less than $6. A bus ride can also be had for a dollar or less. I never purchased a
        scooter but if you purchase from a leaving expat, you can save some money here.</p>

    <h3>Food</h3>

    <p>When it comes to food, don't expect to see a huge price difference when shopping at the grocery stores. The
        place you WILL see a difference is in a restaurant. You can get a pretty nice meal at a local Taiwanese
        place for $5, and you can get AMAZING eats at night markets for even less.</p>

    <p>Here are some basic food items and their prices at local grocery stores (I did most of my shopping at
        Carrefour, a French retailer that is similar to our Wal-Mart).</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Cost in USD</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Eggs - 1 dozen</td>
            <td>1.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Milk - Half Gallon</td>
            <td>1.50</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cheese - 9 oz</td>
            <td>5.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vodka - liter</td>
            <td>12.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Local Beer - .5 Liter bottle</td>
            <td>1.50</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If you want imported foods, you're going to pay extra for it here. Cheese isn't popular in Taiwan, and
        if you want the "good stuff" you're going to pay a pretty penny. This is where a Costco membership can pay off.
        I highly recommend you get one. While they won't have all of the foods you are used to seeing in the US, you can
        find some things that you are likely to be missing. The cheese, ground beef, peanut butter, etc are all priced
        well at the Kaohsiung Costco.</p>


    <h3>Mobile Phone</h3>

    <p>Data is CHEAP in Taiwan. Free wifi is everywhere. I purchased a month of service for 300NTD, which
        was about $9 at the time. When this ran out, I purchased a 6-month plan for $30. I never ran out of
        data. It comes with very few actual "minutes" of talk time, but everyone uses the LINE app to call
        and text anyways. If you already have a cell phone, you can bring it in to a shop and they'll get
        you set up with a new sim card (if your phone is unlocked, that is). As you can see, paying for cell
        service here will not break the bank. Even if you bring an old phone and don't want to put service on it,
        since the free wifi is ALL OVER, you can have a fairly functional phone without paying anything!</p><br>
