    <p>For United States citizens, If you wish to enter Taiwan as a tourist or short-term visitor (less than 90 days),
        you do not need a visa. Per the Taiwanese government website: "No extensions or changes of status are permitted.
        Your U.S. passport must be valid throughout your intended length of stay and you must have a confirmed return
        or onward air ticket." Ok, but say you want to stay longer than 90 days. Say you want to live and work in
        Taiwan, what then?</p>

    <p>To legally stay in the country longer than 90 days (you do NOT want to overstay on a visa, no matter WHAT), you
        will need to get a job that offers visa sponsorship. If you have a 4-year degree and plan on teaching English,
        this won't be hard to do. But what if you don't have a four-year degree? Or what if you just want to work as
        a substitute teacher whenever you feel like it instead of being stuck on a one-year contract working too many
        hours? Well, then you have another option: Taking a visa run.</p>

    <h3>What is a Visa Run?</h3>

    <p>First of all, I need to point out that working here without a work visa is illegal. Will people hire you?
        Yes, they sure will. Will they perhaps send you to hide in a closet when an inspector comes if you are
        working without a visa? Yes, they will. And yes, I have experienced being "hidden" first-hand. Not my finest
        hour.</p>

    <p>But say you are going to do it anyways, because everyone else does it. Then how do you renew your visa
        without going back to the states? You do this by making a visa run. You fly to another country for a day or
        two (or more if you want a nice vacation) and then re-enter Taiwan. You get a new stamp, and voila, another
        90 days to stay. Please note that most airlines REQUIRE that you show a ticket leaving Taiwan within 90s
        days before they let you board your Taiwan-bound flight. I even had to show this when I was leaving the US.
        So make SURE you have a ticket booked out of Taiwan to show the check-in person.</p>

    <h3>Where Should I Go?</h3>

    <p>There are two approaches to doing a visa run. The first is to do it as fast and cheap as possible. You can choose
        not to stay abroad if you do not want to, possibly heading back the same day. The other option is to treat the
        visa run as a kind of vacation and try to have fun.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>I chose a bit of both. A round-trip flight to Macau costs about $100, and the flight is only about an hour
        from the Kaohsiung airport. Macau is considered the "Las Vegas of the East" and you can actually have quite
        a bit of fun there. There are beautiful hotels and casinos (The MGM, Venetian, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons,
        Hard Rock, Studio City and more). Macau is also known for its delicious cuisine, which is a blend of southern
        Chinese and Portuguese cuisine. (You HAVE to try their egg tarts and the baked duck rice- they are to die
        for).</p>

    <p>Wherever you choose to go, I think it's most important to try to make yourself comfortable for this trip. A
        visa run can be stressful in the best of times. Don't make it worse by sleeping in a train station or
        staying in the worst hotel possible that is 122342134 miles from the airport. I did have a friend who went to
        Korea for a week and refused to get a room the entire time. Yup- he stayed "wherever". This included park
        benches (that happened to be equipped with cell chargers) and I think he did spend one night at a bus stop.
        The difference here is that 1) he used to live in Korea and spoke Korean and 2) Korea is a relatively safe
        place. I can't say the same about Macau or some of the other Asian countries. Research BEFORE you go.</p>

    <h3>But is this actually legal?</h3>

    <p> If you're doing a visa run, it's important to remember that you are NOT doing anything illegal.
        Customs agents in other countries may get suspicious, but I have never ever had ANY problems once I arrive
        in Taiwan. They are very lax. But other countries can be less...friendly. In Macau, I recall getting a few
        questions when trying to enter their country. I suppose it was the series of trips in and out of Taiwan
        that caused some suspicion.</p>

    <p>They actually asked to see my resident visa for Taiwan. Of course, I didn't have one of these. Lucky for me, I
        had registered my passport number at the immigration building when I arrived in Taiwan, and because of this I
        had a legit "Chinese Identification Number." This is NOT a resident visa, but this special Chinese identification
        number is supposed to be a substitute for those without resident visas. I handed this official document to
        the customs officer and he didn't say anything to me after that. Yes, sometimes they just try to intimidate you.
        Don't let them- it is perfectly legal to travel around Asia (and that is all your visa run really is- travelling
        around Asia!) and as long as you haven't overstayed any visas you are in the clear.</p>

    <p>In all honesty, I can't say what he would've done if I had nothing to show him. Legally I don't think he
        could have done anything, because I was not breaking any laws. But I was fairly glad to have that
        document to hand him! For this reason alone, it's a pretty good idea to make the National Immigration
        Agency your FIRST STOP when you get to Taiwan. This ID number service is totally free and takes about 5 minutes.
        Besides having a paper for nosy customs officers, you can also open a bank account and will have an
        easier time renting an apartment with this document in-hand.</p><br>
