        <h1>Moving to Taiwan?</h1>

        <h2>Kaohsiung is Taiwan's Most Underrated City.</h2>

<p>As Taiwan’s second largest city after Taipei (over 3 million people!), Kaohsiung is the lesser
    known travel destination most people overlook in favour of the capital. But beneath the cover of this sleepy
    seaside city lies a treasure trove of undiscovered gems. Here are a few reasons why you should make Kaohsiung
    your next home.</p>

<h3>1. Ruifeng Night Market - Famous for DELICIOUS FOOD!</h3>

<p> No trip to Kaohsiung is complete without paying the city’s night markets a visit. If you thought Bangkok’s
    Chatuchak market was happening, you ain’t seen nothing yet. The heart of Kaohsiung beats in its night markets
    where food, shopping and people come together on one long stretch of road. Prepare yourself for aroma bombs,
    long queues, awesome shopping and unbelievable steals. What a night!</p>

<p>From angel fried chicken to stinky tofu, you are sure to find something that will whet your appetite here.</p>

<h3>2. Xinjuejiang Night Market - Famous for UNBELIEVABLE shopping</h3>

<p> When we first arrived in Kaohsiung, we wondered why the malls were as empty as a ghost town on a Wednesday. It
    wasn't long before we solved that mystery. The locals were where all the goodies lay - in the Xinjuejiang
    shopping district.</p>

<p>Fashionistas may just faint at the sight of this endless stretch of street shops so reasonably priced; the $20 in
    your pocket will feel limitless. The best way to shop at night markets is to scour the general area first,
    before going in for the kill. Never buy anything that looks generic on your first stall visit; it’s most likely
    that the shop two doors down has the exact same thing at a fraction of the price.</p>

<h3>3. Lotus Lake</h3>

<p>More than just a place of placidity, the Lotus Lake is home to majestic structures reminiscent of China’s
    palaces. The burst of green from the lotuses in spring is a sight to behold against the backdrop of a serene
    blue lake. It's a wonderful place to spend an afternoon walking, biking and relaxing.</p>

<p>Run into the dragon’s mouth, said no one ever - save for the locals in Kaohsiung. This auspicious custom has got
    locals and tourists running straight into the mouth of the dragon and out from the tiger’s mouth is said to
    reverse one’s fortune from bad to good.</p>

<h3>4. Amazing Art at Pier 2 Art District</h3>

<p>No one would’ve guessed that this quirky arts hub was once an abandoned warehouse at the end of the Kaohsiung
    harbor. With its rustic industrial charm and modern installations, the Pier 2 district is the perfect spot for
    families, couples and the occasional lone man craving a brief respite from city life.</p>

<p>Be inspired by the power of street art in effecting change. The group of artists behind the displayed works are
    the same people who lobbied for this space of their own when it was set to ruin. How cool is that?</p>

<p>The shopping here is amazing and you can find everything from jewelry to antiques to books. Plan to spend at
    least 2 hours wandering around. You can pick up a little map once you arrive and make sure you hit up every
    artist's studio that is open! It is very cool to walk in and talk with some of these artists, and the
    locally crafted items make GREAT souvenirs.</p>

<h3>5. Love River / Downtown Area</h3>
<p>Kaohsiung's downtown area is absolutely beautiful. In the Qianjin District, navigate your way to the river to
    take a little cruise or be serenaded on the Gondolas. At night there are many performers lining the streets,
    and you'll run into quite a few foreigners having beers around this area (just look for the 7-Eleven, this is
    the "hangout" spot).</p>

<p>In addition to the beautiful river, you can also find amazing shopping. From Gucci to Prada, it's here in
    Kaohsiung. And if you're feeling homesick, make your way to Costco!</p>

<h3>6. Monkey Mountain</h3>

<p>If you visit Kaohsiung, you will surely notice the mountains (actually, little more than a hill) right in the middle
    of the town: the longevity mountain (ShouShan, 壽山) and the Monkey mountain (ChaiShan, 柴山). Given that Kaohsiung
    has about 3 million inhabitants and that the entire west coast of Taiwan is densely populated, finding a park
    with a tropical forest and hundreds of wild monkeys just a few kilometers from the city center is nice
    surprise. There are many trails that are suitable for all fitness levels and you're sure to find one to
    enjoy.</p>


<p>Just be careful around the monkeys, they have been known to steal bags and food- remember that they are wild
    animals!</p>

<p>These are just a few of the many wonderful things you can find in this city. If you love nature and the big
    city, Kaohsiung has the best of both worlds.</p><br>
