    <h2>Cool Stuff Around Kaohsiung</h2>

    <p>Kaohsiung has a never-ending list of things to do. Below are some of my favorites.</p>

    <h3>The River</h3>

    <p>I know I mentioned Love River on the main page, but I need to mention it again here. Tourists, locals, and
        expats all congregate here most nights of the week, and especially on weekends. Many expats favor beers by
        the river instead of the bars. Find the benches across from one of the two 7-Elevens, and you will be sure to
        meet some new friends. People are coming and going all evening and it is very much a "hot-spot" among the
        expats.</p>

    <h3>Shopping</h3>

    <p>Kaohsiung has amazing shopping. You can find stores from GUCCI to Tiffany's to "that cute sock shop on the
        corner at the night market" and everything in between. If you are already living downtown, all of these
        shops will be within a ten minute walk. I would also recommend dressing up a little bit if you are going
        shopping- the malls are filled with classy professionals, and if you are in cut-offs and an old tshirt, you
        will probably feel under-dressed and out of place.</p>

    <h3>Central Park</h3>

    <p> Kaohsiungâ€™s Central Park is a rural area in the center of the city with many picturesque features and intriguing
        complexes. The library, the labyrinth and the vast lake are the most prominent attractions in this park,
        attracting joggers, dog-walkers and strolling couples. Escape the hectic bustle of city life for an afternoon in
        this serene park.</p>

    <p>Take a romantic promenade with your partner along the shores of the lake. Waltz along a path that is lined by
        swaying palm trees. It should take between 10 to 20 minutes to traverse the length of the park. Sit with your
        family on the grass and revel in the extraordinary views of green hills, wooden bridges and water features.</p>

    <h3>Take a Weekend Trip</h3>

    <p>Kaohsiung is very close to Kenting, an area on the southern tip of Taiwan known for its beautiful beaches. You
        can take a bus ride there and soak up some rays while you relax on the white sand. If beach-life isn't your
        thing, take a 2 hour train ride north to Taipei. Taipei makes a great weekend trip, but remember it will be
        more expensive there than it is in Kaohsiung!</p>

    <p>Taitung on the east coast is another place you could venture to by train. The east coast is full of beautiful
        beaches (check out Dulan) and mountains for you to explore. </p>

    <h3>Luxury Cinema</h3>

    <p>If you feel like taking in a movie, there is no better place to do it than Vie Cinema near downtown
        Kaohsiung. These theaters know how to do luxury. A luxury ticket that includes a full meal, reclining leather
        seats, chair-side service, and a blanket still comes in well under $20. This is a bargain! They treat you
        like royalty when you purchase a VIP ticket, and I can't say enough about this experience. It was the best
        movie-going experience of my life!</p><br>
