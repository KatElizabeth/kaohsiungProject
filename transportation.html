    <h2>Getting Around - Transportation in Kaohsiung</h2>

    <p>Kaohsiung is packed with people. Transportation CAN be scary. Drivers can be a bit reckless (both car drivers
        and scooter drivers). Though I drove scooter on the east coast (Taitung), once I got to the big metropolis that
        is Kaohsiung, I preferred to take bicycles on sidewalks or less busy streets. Below are some of the most
        common and convenient ways to get around the city!</p>

    <h3>Scooter</h3>

    <p>Travelling by scooter is the most common way to get around in Taiwan. It can be fun, but it is mostly
        terrifying. In my short time there, I knew at least 2 friends that were involved in scooter accidents (and I
        really did not know that many people). It is not uncommon to see a mom, dad, child, baby and DOG all piled on
        to one scooter. This is quite normal to them, but somewhat horrifying to witness.</p>

    <p>If you have an international driver's license, you can legally drive a scooter for 30 days after entering the
        country. If you have a visa, you'll be able to take a driver's test and get a permanent license. Though I don't
        recommend this, I knew of many people without licenses that still drove around daily. It's a risk though,
        because you won't be able to get insurance, and if you get in an accident (which is much more likely here
        than in the US) you could be in pretty big trouble!</p>

    <p>If you are looking to rent or buy a scooter, the best advice is to meet a group of expats and start asking
        around. Often, people who are leaving the country are willing to sell their scooters quickly and at a
        reasonable price.</p>

    <h3>KMRT</h3>

    <p>The Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit System is a rapid transit system covering the metropolitan of Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
        Construction of the KMRT started in October 2001.</p>

    <p>Two of Kaohsiung's MRT stations, Formosa Boulevard Station and Central Park Station, were ranked among the top 50
        most beautiful subway systems in the world by Metrobits.org in 2011. In 2012, the two stations respectively
        are ranked as the 2nd and the 4th among the top 15 most beautiful subway stops in the world</p>

    <p>The KMRT offers fast transportation around a decent portion of the city. It costs approximately 1 USD for a
        token to ride. This depends on the distance traveled, but there is a map at each station showing the cost
        from one station to the next. You can either buy your token at the station, or buy a card at a 7-11 and
        recharge the balance as needed. This makes taking the subway much easier, as you just scan your card every
        time you go in/out of the stations.</p>

    <p>If you choose to get a token at the station- be sure you KEEP the token for the entire ride- you will need to
        deposit it when you exit the station at your destination.</p>

    <h3>Uber vs. Taxi</h3>

    <p>While the subway can get you close to your location, you still may need to walk or bike another 10 or 15
        minutes depending on where you are going. If you want the luxury of being deposited directly at your
        destination, I highly recommend Uber. Taxis work too, but this will be a huge STRUGGLE if you don't speak
        Chinese (I know this from experience).</p>

    <p>The wonderful thing about Uber, is that you simply click on a map where you want to go. The driver shows up
        and no communication is necessary, they have your location plotted on their map and you can just relax
        while they take you to your stop. You also don't have to fuss with money, and this really keeps it simple.</p>

    <h3>Bicycle</h3>

    <p>Bicycle was one of my main modes of transportation in Kaohsiung. The wonderful news about this is that you
        don't have to buy a bike! Kaohsiung has a wonderful city-bike system, and the first 30 minutes of every
        rental is totally free. This means you can get a bike, head towards your destination, and swap it out for
        another bike at a station along the way. This means you can get around the entire city, using their bikes,
        for free.</p>

    <p>To rent a city bike, you'll need either an i-pass card (from a 7-11) or a credit card. Credit cards are the
        easiest to use- just swipe and you are off. I have had the machine "eat" my credit card on one or two
        occasions. While this is a bit stressful, their customer service reps DO speak English. Just make sure you
        have a working cell phone so you can call them, and they'll help you get your card back within a few
        moments.</p><br>
